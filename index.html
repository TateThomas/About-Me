I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I found this to be pretty easy to write. I'm fairly familiar
with html already, but I'm not too familiar with all the html tags that are availible to
use, so that was a good learning experience. I also added some light css just to center
the content and fulfill some of the requirements.

                <h2>Event Horizon (Haiku)</h2>
                <p>I'm fascinated with black holes, and I've done some light undergrad research on them, so I asked ChatGPT to write a Haiku for me, since I do not know how to write them (no code was generated in the process):</p>

                <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>I love to learn. One of my favorite things to learn about is physics; there's so many things that are real in this universe, yet seem so counterintuitive to our daily lives. I also like learning about many other things, like: CS, math, history, etc.</p>
                <p>I also like to play video games. I mostly play the Switch nowadays, since I can take it anywhere and can pause at any time, but I also own a PS4. I'm currently playing through The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4, and I also like to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with my girlfriend. I don't have much time to play video games anymore, unfortunately.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I like to read. I'm currently re-reading Harry Potter (I'm still on the first book), which I haven't read since elementary school. I recently re-watched all of the movies again and became obsessed with Harry Potter again, as I was when I was a kid. I also read textbooks when I get the chance, but once again, I don't have much free time.</p>
